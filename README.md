### Overview:
The On-Account web application originated as a class project that has far surpassed its initial requirements, with a vision to become the go-to solution for non-profits and startups. By supporting those who help others, we envision our efforts multiplying many times over within the communities we serve. Over 24,873 lines of code, and counting, have been contributed to the project. By taking on the heavy lifting and creating this foundational software, we have successfully lowered a significant barrier to entry for business owners. This allows them to focus on the people they are passionate about helping, rather than grappling with the learning curve associated with many bloated accounting packages.

The On-Account system is now a fully functional platform that enhances the efficiency of the basic accounting process. Our software provides secure, user-friendly, and accessible financial management solutions. It can be utilized anywhere and everywhere through an always-available web application. This allows users to manage their financial accounts whenever necessary while maintaining a high level of security. On-Account delivers a simple interface to manage the many complex functionalities that proper bookkeeping demands. These features encompass all the foundational financial calculations, record-keeping, and reporting functionalities necessary for a business to adhere to general accounting principles in a double-entry accrual-based accounting system.
